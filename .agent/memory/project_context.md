# Project Context: Kraken Code

## Primary Goal
Build a CLI-based coding agent (inspired by Claude Code) as a **learning journey**. The focus is on understanding the internal mechanics of agentic loops, tool calling, and context management.

## Vision
To create a "glass box" agent where the underlying logic is transparent and well-documented, allowing the developer to level up from intermediate to senior-level architectural thinking.

## Target Experience Level
**Intermediate (Learning focused)**
- Comfortable with Python basics.
- Highly motivated to learn "Senior Engineer" patterns: intuition, "the why," and systematic design.
- Prefers architectural depth over surface-level implementation.

## Key Learning Pillars
1. **Agentic Loops**: How an agent decides when to stop, when to call a tool, and how to handle errors.
2. **Context Management**: Strategies for maintaining state, token counting, and prompt engineering.
3. **Robust Tooling**: Building a secure and extensible system for interacting with the local environment.
4. **Streaming & UX**: Providing real-time, granular feedback to the user via a polished CLI.
